  sentences:
  - Yeah! Actually. That's a good way of putting it! I feel like a lot of people
    tend to undervalue a little alone time.
  - And it's not like I don't like the other planets... I guess I just feel insecure
    sometimes.
  - I want them to know I like them and care about them... but I get a little overloaded
    when I am around too many people for too long, yknow?
  responses:
  - I'm actually personally more extroverted, but I understand!
