  sentences:
  - That's right, you seem to know your stuff.
  - A lot of these guys around here act all high and mighty, like they're somehow
    more "planet" than me, but I know what's up.
  - All these other guys are lame. They're all bunched together around that damned
    Sun of theirs.
  - They need to learn the value of a little personal space and distance. A little
    alone time.
  - Wouldn't expect a tin can man like you to understand though...
  responses:
  - You're right... I don't... you complain a lot.
  - No I get it. You're more introverted! I get it. Too many people can be a real
    pain in the ass.
